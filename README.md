## Dependencies

 - A **C compiler** supporting the C standard library (e.g. **gcc**)
 - **make**, **flex** and **bison**
 
## Building

To build, run `make`

## Usage

The tool takes a path to a UCI configuration file as argument.

If the syntax is valid, no output is emitted and the tool returns a 0 exit code.
Otherwise, error messages are printed and a non-zero exit code is returned.

Usage:

```sh
ucicheck [-n] filename
````

## Notes

Due to UCI allowing embedded new lines in quoted literals,
unterminated quoted multi-line strings may typically be reported out of sync
(or not at all if a subsequent unbalanced closing quote terminates the unbalanced opening one).

In order to help debugging these cases, calling this tool with the `-n` option
switches to a stricter subset of the UCI syntax which does not allow embedded new lines in string literals.
